To seek help from others more often (though I'm not sure at what point)

I'm so very tired and dejected. SSE was took almost have the project time and didn't work (for me).

(g) What suggestions do you have to improve this assignment?
More C-specific refreshers? It would be nice to be able to go to someone and get direct answers to specific questions, but I understand that it would borderline on making the assignment trivial.

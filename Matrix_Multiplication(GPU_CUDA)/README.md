#Matrix Multiplication: Parallel Computation via GPGPU Programming using CUDA

Optimized square matrix operations on a single GPU with respect to Gigaflops per second (Gflops/s). 
This program achieved a peak of 480 Gflops/s via the use of shared memory, increased instruction-level parallelism, 
and taking advantage of various characteristics of the benchmarking GPU (Nvidia Tesla GK210).
